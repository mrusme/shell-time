Shell Time
----------

*Shell Time* is for your shell, what *Screen Time* is for your phone!

> *Shell Time* lets you know how much time you and your kids spend on CLIs, 
> TUIs, and more. This way, you can make more informed decisions about how you 
> use your terminals.

*Shell Time* shows you your top most used commands, the (rough) amount of time 
you spend in your terminal per day and the hours you seem to be most drawn to 
the command line! It can give you interesting insights into your shell usage and 
remind you of long forgotten tools.
